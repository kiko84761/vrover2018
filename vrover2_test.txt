Script assumes motors for right side are connected to the same output for fwd and for reverse.

Spins 4 motors forward 3 seconds and reverse for 3 seconds.

#White lead goes to right front wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Pink lead goes to right back wheel- forward spin (rt_bk_fwd) - green LED
#Grey lead goes to right back wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Purple Lead goes to left front wheel- forward spin (lft_fr_fwd) - yellow LED
#Yellow lead goes to left front wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
#Green lead goes to left back wheel- forward spin (lft_bk_fwd) - yellow LED
#Orange lead goes to left back wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
