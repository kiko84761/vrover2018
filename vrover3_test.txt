Script assumes each motor is connected to a separate output for fwd and reverse.
    
#turn vehicle left while moving forward for 1 second
turn_left_fwd(1)
#turn vehicle right while moving forward for 1 second
turn_right_fwd(1)
#turn vehicle left while reversing for 1 second
turn_left_rev(1)
#turn vehicle right while reversing for 1 second
turn_right_rev(1)

Code tested on output to LEDs (see video):

#Blue Lead goes to right front wheel- forward spin (rt_fr_fwd) - green LED
#White lead goes to right front wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Pink lead goes to right back wheel- forward spin (rt_bk_fwd) - green LED
#Grey lead goes to right back wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Purple Lead goes to left front wheel- forward spin (lft_fr_fwd) - yellow LED
#Yellow lead goes to left front wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
#Green lead goes to left back wheel- forward spin (lft_bk_fwd) - yellow LED
#Orange lead goes to left back wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
