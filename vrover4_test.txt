Script assumes each motor is connected to a separate output for fwd and reverse.
    
#Pivot vehicle clockwise (right) for 1 second
pivot_right(1)
#Pivot vehicle counterclockwise (left) while moving forward for 1 second
pivot_left(1)

#Goal: Pivot vehicle clockwise (pivot_right), pivot vehicle counter clockwise (pivot_left)
#Clockwise Definition: from a 'birds eye' perspective with 12 o'clock at the front of the vehicle. I.e. "pivot_right"
#Counter-clockwise Definition: from a 'birds eye' perspective with 12 o'clock at the front of the vechicle I.e. "pivot_left"

Code tested on output to LEDs (see video):

#Blue Lead goes to right front wheel- forward spin (rt_fr_fwd) - green LED
#White lead goes to right front wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Pink lead goes to right back wheel- forward spin (rt_bk_fwd) - green LED
#Grey lead goes to right back wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Purple Lead goes to left front wheel- forward spin (lft_fr_fwd) - yellow LED
#Yellow lead goes to left front wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
#Green lead goes to left back wheel- forward spin (lft_bk_fwd) - yellow LED
#Orange lead goes to left back wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
