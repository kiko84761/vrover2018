* vrover5 - Demonstrate Remote Control - DONE - 2/09/2018

Challenge 2: Due by Sunday 9/09/2018

* vrover6 - Measure distance based on HC-SRO4 input
* vrover 7 - Direct vehicle based on sensor input
* Build multi-sensor prototype
* vrover 8 - Direct vehicle based on multi-sensor input

Test -> Use HC-SR04 input mounted on breadboard to light up LEDs

Challenge 3: Due by Sunday 16/09/2018

Define requirements and add code for autonomous vehicle AI
