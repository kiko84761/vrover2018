Script assumes each motor is connected to a separate output for fwd and reverse.

Key bindings:
    
'w': forward 1 second
's': reverse 1 second
'a': turn_left_fwd 1 second
'd': turn_right_fwd 1 second
'q': pivot_left 1 second
'e': pivot_right 1 second
'z': turn_left_rev 1 second
'c': turn_right_rev 1 second


#Goal: Demonstrate capability to drive vehicle based on user input

Code tested on output to LEDs (see video):

#Blue Lead goes to right front wheel- forward spin (rt_fr_fwd) - green LED
#White lead goes to right front wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Pink lead goes to right back wheel- forward spin (rt_bk_fwd) - green LED
#Grey lead goes to right back wheel- reverse spin (rt_fr_rev) - red LED
#Purple Lead goes to left front wheel- forward spin (lft_fr_fwd) - yellow LED
#Yellow lead goes to left front wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
#Green lead goes to left back wheel- forward spin (lft_bk_fwd) - yellow LED
#Orange lead goes to left back wheel- reverse spin (lft_fr_rev) - red LED
